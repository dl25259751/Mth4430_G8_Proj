# what is the "source" of your dataset? you should specify the origin under Dataset section.
# ordinal is a bit tricky that typical discrete variables without orders. make sure you point that out. for instance, naive logistic regression with one-hot encoding for 3 classes (your team's target) can be used, but it is not for ordinal regression in general.
# for generalization, you should consider random splitting and reporting cv errors. at least in this retrospective studies, that is good enough.

# Student_ID: Unique identifier for each student.
# Age and Gender: Demographic information relevant to physiological data interpretation.
# Heart_Rate, Blood_Pressure_Systolic, Blood_Pressure_Diastolic: Physiological measurements gathered from biosensors, indicative of cardiovascular health.
# Stress_Level_Biosensor and Stress_Level_Self_Report: Biosensor and self-reported stress levels on a scale of 1 to 10.
# Physical_Activity and Sleep_Quality: Categorical variables indicating physical activity level (Low, Moderate, High) and sleep quality (Poor, Moderate, Good).
# Mood: Self-reported emotional state categorized as 'Happy', 'Neutral', or 'Stressed'.
# Study_Hours and Project_Hours: Weekly hours dedicated to study and entrepreneurial activities, which are major factors contributing to workload.
# Health_Risk_Level: Target label derived based on stress and lifestyle indicators, categorized as Low, Moderate, or High risk.
